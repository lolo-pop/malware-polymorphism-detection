OVERVIEW
========

This module was created to supplement Python's itertools module, filling in gaps
in two important areas of basic combinatorics:

(A) ordered and unordered m-way combinations, and
(B) generalizations of the four basic occupancy problems ('balls in boxes').

Brief descriptions of the included functions and classes follow (more detailed
descriptions and additional examples can be found in the individual doc strings
within the functions):

n_choose_m(n, m): calculate n-choose-m, using a simple algorithm that is less
likely to involve large integers than the direct evaluation of n! / m! / (n-m)!

m_way_ordered_combinations(items, ks): This function returns a generator that
produces all m-way ordered combinations (multinomial combinations) from the
specified collection of items, with with ks[i] items in the ith group, i= 0, 1,
2, ..., m-1, where m= len(ks) is the number of groups. By 'ordered
combinations', we mean that the relative order of equal- size groups is
important; the order of the items within any group is not important. The total
number of combinations generated is given by the multinomial coefficient formula
(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_theorem#Multinomial_coefficients).

m_way_unordered_combinations(items, ks): This function returns a generator that
produces all m-way unordered combinations from the specified collection of
items, with ks[i] items in the ith group, i= 0, 1, 2, ..., m-1, where m= len(ks)
is the number of groups. By 'unordered combinations', we mean that the relative
order of equal-size groups is not important. The order of the items within any
group is also unimportant.

Example of `m_way_unordered_combinations`::

   Issue the following statement from the IPython prompt:

   from combinatorics import *
   list(m_way_unordered_combinations(6,[2,2,2]))

   The output consists of the 15 combinations listed below:

   (0, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5)
   (0, 1), (2, 4), (3, 5)
   (0, 1), (2, 5), (3, 4)
   (0, 2), (1, 3), (4, 5)
   (0, 2), (1, 4), (3, 5)
   (0, 2), (1, 5), (3, 4)
   (0, 3), (1, 2), (4, 5)
   (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5)
   (0, 3), (1, 5), (2, 4)
   (0, 4), (1, 2), (3, 5)
   (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 5)
   (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3)
   (0, 5), (1, 2), (3, 4)
   (0, 5), (1, 3), (2, 4)
   (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3)

unlabeled_balls_in_labeled_boxes(balls, box_sizes): This function returns a
generator that produces all distinct distributions of indistinguishable balls
among labeled boxes with specified box sizes (capacities). This is a
generalization of the most common formulation of the problem, where each box is
sufficiently large to accommodate all of the balls, and is an important example
of a class of combinatorics problems called 'weak composition' problems.

unlabeled_balls_in_unlabeled_boxes(balls, box_sizes): This function returns a
generator that produces all distinct distributions of indistinguishable balls
among indistinguishable boxes, with specified box sizes (capacities). This is a
generalization of the most common formulation of the problem, where each box is
sufficiently large to accommodate all of the balls. It might be asked, 'In what
sense are the boxes indistinguishable if they have different capacities?' The
answer is that the box capacities must be considered when distributing the
balls, but once the balls have been distributed, the identities of the boxes no
longer matter.

Example of `unlabeled_balls_in_unlabeled_boxes`::

   Issue the following commands from the IPython prompt:

   from combinatorics import *
   list(unlabeled_balls_in_unlabeled_boxes(10,[5,4,3,2,1]))

   The output is as follows:

   [(5, 4, 1, 0, 0),
    (5, 3, 2, 0, 0),
    (5, 3, 1, 1, 0),
    (5, 2, 2, 1, 0),

    (3, 3, 2, 2, 0),
    (3, 3, 2, 1, 1),
    (3, 2, 2, 2, 1)]

labeled_balls_in_unlabeled_boxes(balls, box_sizes): This function returns a
generator that produces all distinct distributions of distinguishable balls
among indistinguishable boxes, with specified box sizes (capacities). This is a
generalization of the most common formulation of the problem, where each box is
sufficiently large to accommodate all of the balls.

labeled_balls_in_labeled_boxes(balls, box_sizes): This function returns a

Example of `labeled_balls_in_labeled_boxes`::

   Issue the following statements from the IPython prompt:

   from combinatorics import *
   list(labeled_balls_in_labeled_boxes(3,[2,2]))

   The output is as follows:

   [((0, 1), (2,)),
    ((0, 2), (1,)),
    ((1, 2), (0,)),
    ((0,), (1, 2)),
    ((1,), (0, 2)),
    ((2,), (0, 1))]

partitions(n): 'In number theory and combinatorics, a partition of a positive
integer n, also called an integer partition, is a way of writing n as a sum of
positive integers. Two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are
considered to be the same partition.'  We can trivially generate all partitions
of an integer using `unlabeled_balls_in_unlabeled_boxes`.  The quote is from
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory) .

REVISION HISTORY
================

10-09-2011, Phillip M. Feldman: I added a function to generate partitions, but
have not updated the version number because I regard this as a trivial change.

10-01-2011, version 1.1.0, Phillip M. Feldman:

I added input error checking to the `labeled_balls_in_unlabeled_boxes` function.

I fixed the function `m_way_ordered_combinations` so that the box order
specified via the input argument `ks` is respected.

I added the function `labeled_balls_in_labeled_boxes`.  This completes the basic
set of functions for solving occupancy functions with capacity limits.

   OVERVIEW

   This function returns a generator that produces all m-way ordered
   combinations (multinomial combinations) from the specified collection of
   items, with ks[i] items in the ith group, i= 0, 1, 2, ..., m-1, where m=
   len(ks) is the number of groups.  By 'ordered combinations', we mean that the
   relative order of equal-size groups is important.  The order of the items
   within any group is not important.  The total number of combinations
   generated is given by the multinomial coefficient formula (see below).


   INPUTS

   `items` must be (A) a list, tuple, or other iterable, or (B) a positive
   integer.  If `items` is an integer, it is replaced by `range(items)`.

   `ks` should be either a list or tuple containing non-negative integers, where
   the sum of these integers does not exceed the length of `items`.


   EXAMPLE

   Let items=[0,1,2,3,4,5] and ks=[2,2,2].  The output includes a total of 90
   combinations.  Two of these are the following:

   ((0, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5))
   ((2, 3), (0, 1), (4, 5))

   These are distinct because the order of the groups, which differs, is
   significant.


   NOTES

   The total number of combinations generated is given by the following
   multinomial coefficient:

                n!
   ----------------------------
   k_0! * k_1! * ... * k_(m-1)!

   where n is the number of items, m is the number of groups, and k_i is the
   number of items in the ith group.

   NOTES

   When all group sizes are unequal, the total number of combinations generated
   is given by the multinomial coefficient (see above).  When two or more groups
   have equal sizes, the number of combinations is less than the multinomial
   coefficient because combinations that differ only in the relative order of
   equal-size groups are excluded.
